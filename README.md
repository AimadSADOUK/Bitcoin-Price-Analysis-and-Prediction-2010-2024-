# Bitcoin Price Analysis and Prediction 2010-2024
This project analyzes Bitcoin price data from 2010 to 2024, focusing on daily closing prices, volumes, and price ranges. Through
visualizations like line plots, histograms, heatmaps etc..., the goal is to identify trends, relationships, and insights, including price
movements, trading volumes, and correlations. Statistical methods like correlation matrices and groupby operations are used for deeper
analysis.

## Skills Used:
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, Numpy for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn for trend analysis and correlation heatmaps.
- **Machine Learning:** Linear Regression, train-test split, and predictive analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Feature scaling with StandardScaler.
- **Programming:** Python for end-to-end data analysis and modeling.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Visualization:** Generated meaningful charts like line plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to identify trends and correlations.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features like 'Price Range' and standardized the dataset for analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Built a linear regression model to predict closing prices and achieved an MAE of ~0.008.
- **Insightful Analysis:** Observed relationships between Bitcoin's high, low, and volume attributes, contributing to the predictive model.
